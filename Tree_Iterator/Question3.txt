3. I don't really understand the question but I thought of a few possible ways.

One way is just to start an iterator on the base component, and because the decorator pattern is inherently recursive
just keep a reference of where the iterator is and pass the iterator through the decorator. You can store the outermost object with the iterator and change it with each call.

Another way which might be cheating is to create a structure within the base component like a queue, and just store each item
as you decorate inside of the queue and then just iterate through that to get the decorations.
